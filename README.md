# Case Study: Predicting Company Bankruptcy Using Financial Data
 Objective: To perform an in-depth analysis of a financial dataset to predict the likelihood of a
 company going bankrupt. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis
 (EDA), hypothesis testing, feature engineering and selection, and applying machine learning
 techniques for classification.
# Tasks:
1. Data Understanding and Preprocessing:
o Load and inspect the dataset.
o Handle missing values appropriately.
o Detect and handle outliers.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
o Generate descriptive statistics.
o Visualize feature distributions and target variable.
o Analyze relationships between features and the target variable.
3. Hypothesis Testing:
o Perform hypothesis testing to identify significant features influencing bankruptcy.
4. Feature Engineering and Selection:
o Create new features to enhance predictive power.
o Use dimensionality reduction techniques if necessary.
o Select relevant features using methods like RFE or feature importance.
5. Modeling:
o Split the data into training and testing sets.
o Apply Logistic Regression for classification.
o Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
6. Model Interpretation and Insights:
o Interpret model coefficients to understand feature impact.
o Summarize key insights and discuss implications for financial risk management.
o Provide actionable recommendations.

# Deliverables:
 Detailed report of the analysis.
 Python code used.
 Supporting visualizations and tables.
 Presentation summarizing findings and recommendations.
Dataset:
 Provided financial dataset with 96 columns (95 features and 1 target variable).
 Target variable: Bankrupt? (1 for bankruptcy, 0 for non-bankruptcy).
